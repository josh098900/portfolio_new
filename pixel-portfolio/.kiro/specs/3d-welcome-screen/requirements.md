# 3D Welcome Screen Requirements

## Introduction

Add an interactive 3D welcome screen featuring a waving robot character from Spline that greets visitors to the portfolio. This creates an engaging first impression that combines modern 3D graphics with the existing pixel art theme.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Welcome Screen Display

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to see an engaging 3D welcome screen when I first visit the portfolio, so that I get a memorable first impression.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the portfolio for the first time THEN the system SHALL display a full-screen welcome overlay
2. WHEN the welcome screen is displayed THEN the system SHALL show a 3D waving robot character from Spline
3. WHEN the welcome screen is active THEN the system SHALL prevent interaction with the main portfolio content behind it
4. WHEN the 3D model loads THEN the system SHALL display a loading state until the model is ready

### Requirement 2: Welcome Screen Dismissal

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to easily dismiss the welcome screen and access the main portfolio, so that I can explore the content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks anywhere on the welcome screen THEN the system SHALL dismiss the overlay with a smooth animation
2. WHEN a user presses the Escape key THEN the system SHALL dismiss the welcome screen
3. WHEN the welcome screen is dismissed THEN the system SHALL reveal the main portfolio content
4. WHEN the welcome screen is dismissed THEN the system SHALL remember this state to avoid showing it again during the session

### Requirement 3: Welcome Screen Content

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to see welcoming text alongside the 3D character, so that I understand this is a portfolio introduction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the welcome screen is displayed THEN the system SHALL show a welcome message with the portfolio owner's name
2. WHEN the welcome screen is displayed THEN the system SHALL include a subtitle describing the portfolio purpose
3. WHEN the welcome screen is displayed THEN the system SHALL show a "Click anywhere to enter" instruction
4. WHEN the text is displayed THEN the system SHALL use pixel-style fonts to match the portfolio theme

### Requirement 4: 3D Model Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to properly integrate the Spline 3D model, so that it loads efficiently and works across devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating the 3D model THEN the system SHALL use the Spline React component for Next.js
2. WHEN the 3D model loads THEN the system SHALL handle loading states gracefully
3. WHEN the 3D model fails to load THEN the system SHALL show a fallback welcome screen without 3D content
4. WHEN on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL ensure the 3D model performs adequately or provide alternatives

### Requirement 5: Performance and Accessibility

**User Story:** As a visitor with different devices and accessibility needs, I want the welcome screen to work well for everyone, so that all users can access the portfolio.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the 3D model is loading THEN the system SHALL not block the main thread or cause performance issues
2. WHEN users have reduced motion preferences THEN the system SHALL respect these settings
3. WHEN users are on slow connections THEN the system SHALL provide a timeout and fallback option
4. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels and descriptions

### Requirement 6: Session Management

**User Story:** As a returning visitor in the same session, I want to skip the welcome screen, so that I can quickly access the portfolio content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has already seen the welcome screen in the current session THEN the system SHALL not show it again
2. WHEN a user refreshes the page THEN the system SHALL remember they've seen the welcome screen
3. WHEN a user opens the portfolio in a new tab THEN the system SHALL check if they've seen the welcome screen in other tabs
4. WHEN the browser session ends THEN the system SHALL reset the welcome screen state for the next visit
